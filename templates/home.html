	<h2>Hi everyone! My name is Comma Bean.</h2>
	<hr class="small" />
	<p>I am a twelve year old Yorkshire Terrier. I am a very fancy dog, as I have come from as far as France to be with you all. I really hate the idea of Brexit.</p>
	<p>My favourite food is all food, but I really like chicken and chicken bones.</p>
